## 4. ADM Guidelines and Techniques

The ADM Guidelines and Techniques provide additional information to support the application of the ADM. These guidelines help architects to adapt and apply the ADM in various scenarios and contexts.

### 4.1 Applying Iteration to the ADM

Iteration is a key concept in the ADM. It allows for flexibility and adaptability in the architecture development process.

**Types of Iteration:**

1. **Iteration of the Overall Process:**
   - Cycling through the entire ADM repeatedly to develop a complete set of architecture deliverables.
   - Each cycle increases the level of detail and/or expands the scope of the architecture.

2. **Iteration Between Phases:**
   - Revisiting an earlier phase to refine outputs based on insights gained in later phases.
   - Example: Returning to the Business Architecture phase after completing the Technology Architecture phase to refine business models.

3. **Iteration Within a Phase:**
   - Repeating activities within a single phase to develop and validate the outputs of that phase.
   - Example: Iterating through stakeholder concerns in Phase A to ensure all perspectives are captured.

**Best Practices for Iteration:**
- Define clear iteration cycles with specific objectives.
- Use iteration to manage complexity by breaking down large architecture efforts into manageable chunks.
- Ensure each iteration adds value and moves the architecture closer to its target state.
- Use iteration to validate assumptions and refine the architecture based on feedback.

### 4.2 Applying the ADM at Different Enterprise Levels

The ADM can be applied at various levels within an enterprise, from organization-wide to specific domains or projects.

**Levels of Application:**

1. **Enterprise-wide:**
   - Addresses the entire organization's architecture.
   - Provides an overarching framework for more detailed architecture work.

2. **Segment or Domain:**
   - Focuses on a specific business segment or domain within the enterprise.
   - Example: Developing architecture for the finance department or customer relationship management.

3. **Project or Capability-specific:**
   - Applies to individual projects or specific capabilities.
   - Ensures alignment with broader enterprise architecture goals.

**Guidelines for Multi-level Application:**
- Ensure consistency and alignment between different levels of architecture work.
- Use higher-level architectures to guide and constrain lower-level efforts.
- Propagate changes and insights from lower levels up to inform enterprise-wide architecture.
