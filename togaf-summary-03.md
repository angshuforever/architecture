The ADM is iterative, over the whole process, between phases, and within phases. For each iteration of the ADM, a fresh decision must be taken as to:

- The breadth of coverage of the enterprise to be defined
- The level of detail to be defined
- The extent of the time horizon aimed at
- The architectural assets to be leveraged in the organization's Architecture Repository

This flexibility allows architects to customize the ADM to deal with a wide variety of different situations.
