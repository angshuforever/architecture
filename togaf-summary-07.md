## 8. Architecture Capability Framework

The Architecture Capability Framework is a set of resources, guidelines, templates, background information, and processes to help establish and operate an enterprise architecture practice within an organization. It addresses the organization, processes, skills, roles, and responsibilities required to create and operate an architecture function.

### 8.1 Architecture Board

The Architecture Board is a key element of architecture governance. It is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the enterprise architecture.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. Provide architectural direction and guidance
2. Review and approve architectural decisions
3. Ensure compliance with established architectures
4. Manage architectural risks
5. Resolve architectural issues and conflicts

**Typical Membership:**

- Chief Architect (Chair)
- Business Unit Representatives
- IT Leaders (CIO, CTO)
- Enterprise Architects
- Security Architect
- Data Architect
- Application Architect
- Infrastructure Architect

**Best Practices:**

1. Clearly define the board's charter and authority
2. Establish regular meeting schedules
3. Develop and maintain architecture principles and standards
4. Implement a formal review process for architecture deliverables
5. Communicate decisions and rationale to stakeholders
6. Periodically review the effectiveness of the board

### 8.2 Architecture Compliance

Architecture compliance ensures that implementation projects adhere to the established enterprise architecture. It involves reviewing projects against architectural standards and principles.

**Types of Architecture Compliance Reviews:**

1. **Project-Focused Reviews:** Conducted at key project milestones
2. **Contract-Focused Reviews:** Ensure compliance of outsourced or procured solutions
3. **Portfolio-Focused Reviews:** Assess the overall alignment of the project portfolio with architecture

**Key Elements of Compliance Reviews:**

1. Architecture Compliance review process
2. Architecture Compliance review checklists
3. Statement of Architecture Compliance
4. Compliance Assessment Report

**Best Practices:**

1. Integrate compliance reviews into the project lifecycle
2. Develop clear compliance criteria and checklists
3. Provide guidance and support to project teams
4. Focus on adding value, not just enforcing rules
5. Document and communicate review outcomes
6. Follow up on compliance issues and recommendations

### 8.3 Architecture Contracts

Architecture Contracts are formal agreements that help ensure project compliance with the enterprise architecture. They define the deliverables, responsibilities, and conformance criteria for implementation projects.

**Key Components of an Architecture Contract:**

1. Parties involved and their responsibilities
2. Scope of the architecture work
3. Architecture principles and standards to be applied
4. Deliverables and their acceptance criteria
5. Conformance requirements and evaluation process
6. Consequences of non-conformance
7. Change management process

**Benefits of Architecture Contracts:**

1. Clarify expectations for all parties
2. Provide a basis for measuring architecture compliance
3. Support governance and risk management
4. Facilitate communication between architects and implementers

**Best Practices:**

1. Tailor contracts to the specific needs of each project
2. Ensure contracts are clear, concise, and unambiguous
3. Review and update contracts as the architecture evolves
4. Involve key stakeholders in contract development
5. Integrate contracts with overall project management processes

### 8.4 Architecture Governance

Architecture Governance is the practice and orientation by which enterprise architectures and other architectures are managed and controlled. It is typically performed by the Architecture Board.

**Key Aspects of Architecture Governance:**

1. Defining architecture principles and standards
2. Guiding architecture development
3. Overseeing architecture implementation
4. Managing architectural change
5. Ensuring compliance with architecture

**Architecture Governance Framework:**

1. **Processes:** Define how architecture decisions are made and enforced
2. **Roles and Responsibilities:** Clarify who is responsible for various aspects of architecture governance
3. **Standards and Guidelines:** Establish the rules and best practices for architecture work
4. **Metrics and Monitoring:** Define how architecture performance and compliance are measured
5. **Audit and Reporting:** Establish mechanisms for reviewing and communicating architecture governance

**Best Practices:**

1. Align architecture governance with overall IT and corporate governance
2. Establish clear decision-making processes and authority
3. Communicate governance policies and decisions effectively
4. Balance governance with agility and innovation
5. Regularly review and improve governance practices

### 8.5 Architecture Maturity Models

Architecture Maturity Models help organizations assess and improve their architecture capability. They provide a framework for evaluating the current state of architecture practice and planning for improvement.

**TOGAF Architecture Maturity Model:**

Level 1: Initial
- Ad hoc architecture practices
- No defined processes or standards

Level 2: Under Development
- Basic architecture processes established
- Some standardization, but inconsistent application

Level 3: Defined
- Well-defined architecture processes
- Consistent application across the organization

Level 4: Managed
- Architecture practices are measured and controlled
- Quantitative goals for quality and process performance

Level 5: Optimizing
- Continuous improvement of architecture practices
- Innovation and optimization based on quantitative understanding

**Using Maturity Models:**

1. Assess current architecture maturity
2. Identify gaps and areas for improvement
3. Set targets for maturity improvement
4. Develop action plans to reach target maturity levels
5. Regularly reassess and adjust plans

**Best Practices:**

1. Use maturity assessments as a tool for improvement, not criticism
2. Involve a cross-section of stakeholders in the assessment process
3. Set realistic and achievable maturity targets
4. Align maturity improvement efforts with business goals
5. Celebrate progress and achievements in maturity improvement

### 8.6 Architecture Skills Framework

The Architecture Skills Framework defines the roles, skills, and experience needed to effectively practice enterprise architecture.

**Key Roles in Enterprise Architecture:**

1. **Enterprise Architect:** Oversees the overall enterprise architecture
2. **Domain Architects:** Specialists in business, data, application, or technology architecture
3. **Solution Architects:** Focus on specific solutions or projects
4. **Architecture Manager:** Manages the architecture team and processes

**Skill Categories:**

1. **Generic Skills:** Communication, leadership, teamwork, etc.
2. **Business Skills and Methods:** Business case development, business process modeling, etc.
3. **Enterprise Architecture Skills:** TOGAF knowledge, architecture modeling, etc.
4. **Program and Project Management Skills:** Program management, change management, etc.
5. **IT General Knowledge Skills:** Application development, data management, etc.
6. **Technical IT Skills:** Software engineering, security, networking, etc.
7. **Legal Environment:** Data protection, procurement law, etc.

**Developing Architecture Skills:**

1. Assess current skill levels within the architecture team
2. Identify skill gaps based on organizational needs
3. Develop training and development plans
4. Provide opportunities for practical experience and mentoring
5. Encourage professional certifications (e.g., TOGAF certification)
6. Regularly review and update skill requirements

**Best Practices:**

1. Align skill development with organizational architecture goals
2. Foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement
3. Encourage knowledge sharing within the architecture team
4. Provide diverse experiences to develop well-rounded architects
5. Balance technical skills with business and soft skills
6. Stay updated with emerging trends and technologies in enterprise architecture

The Architecture Capability Framework provides a comprehensive approach to establishing and maintaining an effective enterprise architecture practice. By addressing governance, compliance, contracts, maturity, and skills, organizations can develop a robust architecture capability that delivers value to the business and supports strategic goals.
